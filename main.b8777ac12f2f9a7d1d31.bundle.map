This is\n\t * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\n\t * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\n\t * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\n\t * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\n\t *\n\t * We can use this script code:\n\t *\n\t * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\n\t *\n\t * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\n\t * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\n\t *\n\t *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\n\t *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\n\t *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\n\t *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\n\t *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\n\t *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\n\t *     domain instance.\n\t *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\n\t *     template into it.\n\t *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\n\t *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\n\t *     application.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\n\t *\n\t * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\n\t * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\n\t * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\n\t * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\n\t * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\n\t *\n\t * Each application has its own private injector as well. When there are multiple\n\t * applications on a page, Angular treats each application injector's services as private\n\t * to that application.\n\t *\n\t * ## API\n\t *\n\t * - `appComponentType`: The root component which should act as the application.

This is\n * mainly for security reasons, as well as architectural changes in Angular 2. This means\n * that `index.html` can safely be processed using server-side technologies such as\n * providers. Bindings can thus use double-curly `{{ syntax }}` without collision from\n * Angular 2 component double-curly `{{ syntax }}`.\n *\n * We can use this script code:\n *\n * {@example core/ts/bootstrap/bootstrap.ts region='bootstrap'}\n *\n * When the app developer invokes `bootstrap()` with the root component `MyApp` as its\n * argument, Angular performs the following tasks:\n *\n *  1. It uses the component's `selector` property to locate the DOM element which needs\n *     to be upgraded into the angular component.\n *  2. It creates a new child injector (from the platform injector). Optionally, you can\n *     also override the injector configuration for an app by invoking `bootstrap` with the\n *     `componentInjectableBindings` argument.\n *  3. It creates a new `Zone` and connects it to the angular application's change detection\n *     domain instance.\n *  4. It creates an emulated or shadow DOM on the selected component's host element and loads the\n *     template into it.\n *  5. It instantiates the specified component.\n *  6. Finally, Angular performs change detection to apply the initial data providers for the\n *     application.\n *\n *\n * ## Bootstrapping Multiple Applications\n *\n * When working within a browser window, there are many singleton resources: cookies, title,\n * location, and others. Angular services that represent these resources must likewise be\n * shared across all Angular applications that occupy the same browser window. For this\n * reason, Angular creates exactly one global platform object which stores all shared\n * services, and each angular application injector has the platform injector as its parent.\n *\n * Each application has its own private injector as well.

This is\n *   a reference to a `Type` which is annotated with `@Component(...)`.\n * - `customProviders`: An additional set of providers that can be added to the\n *   app injector to override default injection behavior.\n *\n * Returns a `Promise` of {@link ComponentRef}.\n *\n * @experimental This api cannot be used with the offline compiler and thus is still subject to\n * change.\n */\nfunction bootstrap(appComponentType, customProviders) {\n    core_private_1.reflector.reflectionCapabilities = new core_private_1.ReflectionCapabilities();\n    var providers = [\n        platform_browser_1.BROWSER_APP_PROVIDERS, exports.BROWSER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS,\n        lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ? customProviders : []\n    ];\n    var appInjector = core_1.ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate(providers, platform_browser_1.browserPlatform().injector);\n    return core_1.coreLoadAndBootstrap(appComponentType, appInjector);\n}\nexports.bootstrap = bootstrap;\n/**\n * @experimental\n */\nfunction bootstrapWorkerUi(workerScriptUri, customProviders) {\n    var app = core_1.ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([\n        platform_browser_1.WORKER_UI_APPLICATION_PROVIDERS, exports.BROWSER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS,\n        { provide: platform_browser_1.WORKER_SCRIPT, useValue: workerScriptUri },\n        lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ? customProviders : []\n    ], platform_browser_1.workerUiPlatform().injector);\n    // Return a promise so that we keep the same semantics as Dart,\n    // and we might want to wait for the app side to come up\n    // in the future...\n    return async_1.PromiseWrapper.resolve(app.get(core_1.ApplicationRef));\n}\nexports.bootstrapWorkerUi = bootstrapWorkerUi;\n/**\n * @experimental\n */\nvar WORKER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS = [\n    compiler_1.COMPILER_PROVIDERS, {\n        provide: compiler_1.CompilerConfig,\n        useFactory: function (platformDirectives, platformPipes) {\n            return new compiler_1.CompilerConfig({ platformDirectives: platformDirectives, platformPipes: platformPipes });\n        },\n        deps: [core_1.PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES, core_1.PLATFORM_PIPES]\n    },\n    { provide: compiler_1.XHR, useClass: xhr_impl_1.XHRImpl },\n    { provide: core_1.PLATFORM_DIRECTIVES, useValue: common_1.COMMON_DIRECTIVES, multi: true },\n    { provide: core_1.PLATFORM_PIPES, useValue: common_1.COMMON_PIPES, multi: true }\n];\n/**\n * @experimental\n */\nfunction bootstrapWorkerApp(appComponentType, customProviders) {\n    var appInjector = core_1.ReflectiveInjector.resolveAndCreate([\n        platform_browser_1.WORKER_APP_APPLICATION_PROVIDERS, WORKER_APP_COMPILER_PROVIDERS,\n        lang_1.isPresent(customProviders) ? customProviders : []\n    ], platform_browser_1.workerAppPlatform().injector);\n    return core_1.coreLoadAndBootstrap(appComponentType, appInjector);\n}\nexports.bootstrapWorkerApp = bootstrapWorkerApp;\n//# sourceMappingURL=index.js.map\n\n\n/*****************\n ** WEBPACK FOOTER\n ** ./~/@angular/platform-browser-dynamic/index.js\n ** module id = 557\n ** module chunks = 2\n **/","/**\n * @license\n * Copyright Google Inc.
